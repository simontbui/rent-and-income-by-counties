I've been planning on relocating in the foreseeable future and was curious as to what cost of living would be like in other areas in the U.S. Data regarding median rent (fair market rents) per county (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr.html) and per capita income by county (https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/personal-income-county-metro-and-other-areas). The median rent values include the cost of utilities.
