## IN PROGRESS!

I've been planning on relocating in the foreseeable future and was curious as to what the cost of living would be like in other areas in the U.S. This is an in-progress hobby analysis that will use PostgreSQL, Python, a lot of data transformations, and some visualization and data summaries. I might whip something up with Tableau or some other interactive UI if time permits.

## Data Sources:
1. Median rent by county: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr.html. Rent includes the cost of utilities.
2. Per capita income by county: https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/personal-income-county-metro-and-other-areas
